CSS Filters
===========

Presenting CSS Filters for Create the Web

Prep Work
---------
If you don't want to be dependent on having an Internet connection during your presentation, I'd recommend you install FilterLab locally.

Head on over to https://github.com/adobe/cssfilterlab and follow the instructions in the README for installing, building and running FilterLab locally. I highly recommend this avenue.

Regardless, even if you decide not to run FilterLab locally, you'll need to be running Google Chrome Canary or WebKit nightly to be able to see the custom filters in action.

Presenting Filters

1. Open up the Reveal.js presentation associated with this project.
