Presenting CSS Filters for Create the Web

Prep work:
----------
If you don't want to be dependent on having an Internet connection during your presentation, I'd recommend you install FilterLab locally.

Head on over to https://github.com/adobe/cssfilterlab and follow the instructions in the README for installing, building and running FilterLab locally.  I highly recommend this avenue.
